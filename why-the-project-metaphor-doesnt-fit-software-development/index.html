Together with an 
architect and the contractor I worked out the features. We wanted a basement, we 
carefully picked the materials, the location of the windows, the placement of 
the rooms, the bathroom, the attic and everything the contractor needed to come 
up with a price and a delivery date. About a year-and-a-half later the house was 
completed.</em></p><p>Looking at this project from a mile high, it appears to be a regular 
construction project. The requirements were specified, the contractor came up 
with a price and a date, and about a year-and-a-half later the project was 
delivered. One might suggest that this model for construction projects is a 
fairly suitable model for software development projects as well. You specify the 
requirements, set the price and delivery date, and of you go. And many managers 
and project managers actually <em><strong>do </strong></em>suggest this model 
for software development projects, supported by the fact that we have been using 
this model since the seventies, most often referred to as waterfall or 
linear.</p><p>Unfortunately, the waterfall or linear model, where we identify with all the 
requirements and pour them in concrete before we start the actual construction, 
doesn’t really work that well. Many, many contractors fail to meet their budget 
or deadline, or only deliver a very small part of the agreed requirements. 
Recent publications on large government projects in the Netherlands show 
dramatic negative results and failing projects. Clients blame contractors, and 
contractors in their turn blame clients for demanding the projects to be 
executed following this  linear model. Many projects end in court and our 
beloved software development discipline has a negative public image.</p><p>So where does it all go wrong? Let me try and explain.</p><h2>Software development is a very young discipline</h2><p>When we try to model our software development projects to a metaphor coming 
from civil engineering we bypass the notion that civil engineering has been 
around for thousands of years. There is a world of experience and knowledge in 
construction from the Babylonians, the Greek, the Egyptians, the Middle Ages, 
Renaissance and industrial revolutions. Two thousand years ago the Romans 
already used concrete. All this experience contributes to how construction 
projects are executed today.</p><p>Software development on the other hand is a very young discipline. Where 
mathematics and concrete have been around for a very long time, programming 
languages are only about sixty years old. Hence, applying a project model from a 
discipline from a thousands years old discipline might not fit very well. We 
just don’t have this experience. Yet.</p><h2>Construction projects also fail</h2><p>Nevertheless, even with these thousands of years of experience and technology 
development, construction projects using this one-pass model also still fail. 
Right after my new house was delivered by the contractor, we started noticing a 
terrible smell from the toilets.  After two weeks the situation got worse. We 
couldn’t even flush the toilet anymore. The system was totally constipated. To 
cut a long story short, the contractor had totally forgotten to connect the 
house to the city’s central sewerage. Repairing this “bug” meant that my just 
finished garden was ruined.</p><p>So the single-pass model doesn’t really fit construction either. And building 
a single house is not that big a project. When you investigate much larger 
construction projects, projects that have actually implemented the agreed 
requirements on-time and on-budget are exceptions, not the rule. So if 
construction projects don’t even work on a linear model, how could software 
development projects? </p><h2>In software development requirements can change</h2><p>And there is more. When I had my house built, I needed to take a lot of 
decisions up front. Although I didn’t have to decide about how high on the wall 
the sockets were going to be placed, it isn’t hard to figure out that adding a 
basement after a house is fully completed is a lot harder than installing it 
before the floors are added. And the same goes for the sewerage. You could well 
say that most of the architecture and design needs to be done up-front. Software 
development however, is very, very different. Software can always  change. Even 
late in a project we can change our requirements, the user interface, and even 
the architecture. Therefore, we do not need this big up-front design.</p><p>The fact that (too) many projects still rely on this big up-front design, is 
because we are applying the wrong model to our projects. Applying a big up-front 
design in software development projects has a negative effect on the outcome of 
these projects, because it disallows change. And change is beneficial. Being 
able to change during a project, even late in the project, simply improves 
quality, and improves the ability to maximize the benefits of the software we 
build for our clients.    </p><p>The fact that we can change our requirements, design and even our 
architecture make software development projects very different other 
construction projects. Software is fluid, non-linear, and we should benefit from 
this.</p><h2>Projects are not the right metaphor</h2><p>And in my opinion, that’s not all. As said, after we worked out the features 
of my new house my contractor came up with a price and a delivery date. So we 
fixed the features, the price and the delivery date. Essentially the same three 
factors that are used to monitor the success of software development projects. 
Often I ask project managers to describe when they consider their projects to be 
successful.  Continuously I get the response that if all the features are 
delivered on-time and on-budget the project is a success. But is it? </p><p>Please consider Microsoft Word. A product with thousands of features of which 
most people only use a very limited number of.  Would it have been a successful 
product even if it only delivered this limited set of features? For a fraction 
of the budget it now took to build? My guess is it would. I traded in Microsoft 
Word for a simple, straightforward text editor long ago.</p><p>What if, instead of using the project model decides to build our software 
feature by feature? And if we would only build the minimum version of those 
features that does just enough. We could continuously ask the client how he of 
she wants to spend the next bit of time and money. Should we build a more fancy 
version of the current feature, or the minimum version of the next feature on 
the list? Every product build like this would have the minimum set of features, 
built for a minimal budget in a minimal amount of time. Delivered earlier than 
it would have been using a project model – linear or agile for that matter. 
Delivered cheaper that using a project model. And with only those features we 
really need. Built like this, Microsoft Word would have been a lean and mean 
editor, without all the abundant features it now has. </p><p>So I rest my case. In my opinion software should not be built using a project 
model. Never. Software should rather be implemented feature by feature, 
delivering a minimal viable product. And in case you’re wondering, my house was 
neither delivered on-time nor on-budget. So please stop doing projects.</p></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--article color-title color-text w-100p p-1  color-bg  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="17"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r" data-reactid="18"><p><em>In 2009 I hired a building contractor to build a house.
